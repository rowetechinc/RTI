 * HISTORY
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * Date            Initials    Version    Comments
 * -----------------------------------------------------------------
 * 02/01/2012      RC          1.14       Initial coding
 * 02/07/2012      RC          2.00       Added a method SetDefaults().
 *                                         Removed the CWPAI extra properties.
 *                                         Added method IsEnableCWPAI().
 * 02/10/2012      RC          2.02       Changed default values to match Adcp User Guide Rev F and CDEFAULT in firmware v0.2.04.
 * 08/29/2012      RC          2.14       Added an default constructor.  This constructor is used when default values are not needed.
 *                                         Check in SetFrequencyDefaults() if Subsystem is not null before setting the frequency default settings.
 * 08/29/2012      RC          2.15       Changed how defaults are set to allow outside users to set the defaults with and without a subsystem set.
 * 09/06/2012      RC          2.15       Update the commands to the ADCP manual Revision G.
 * 09/10/2012      RC          2.15       Make 300Khz the default frequency if one is not set.
 *                                         Bug in CBTMX command firmware.  Commented out so the user cannot send the setting for now.
 * 09/26/2012      RC          2.15       Validate the values when settings.
 *                                         Added CWPAP command.
 * 10/03/2012      RC          2.15       Added CEPO Index property.  Give the CEPO index in the constructor.
 * 10/04/2012      RC          2.15       Added CBI command.
 * 10/10/2012      RC          2.15       When creating the command list, ensure the string is set to United States English format.  This is to prevent commas from being used for decimal points.
 * 10/16/2012      RC          2.15       Validate the min and max values for the commands.
 * 10/17/2012      RC          2.15       Added Min/Max values for the CWPAP commands.
 * 11/20/2012      RC          2.16       Created CmdStr to output the command string for reach command with the command, CEPO index and the values.
 * 12/20/2012      RC          2.17       Updated comments to ADCP User Guide Rev H.
 *                                         Added 2 new WP broadband pulse types based off ADCP User Guide Rev H.
 * 12/27/2012      RC          2.17       Replaced Subsystem.Empty with Subsystem.IsEmpty().
 * 05/30/2013      RC          2.19       Replaced Subsystem and CepoIndex with SubsystemConfig which contains this information.
 * 06/11/2013      RC          2.19       Added CBI_BurstPairFlag.
 * 06/14/2013      RC          2.19       Added GetDeploymentCommandList().
 * 09/17/2013      RC          2.20.0     Updated CWPBB_TransmitPulseType options to user guide rev N.
 *                                         Removed the CBI command from the GetDeploymentCommandList().
 * 09/22/2014      RC          3.0.2      Added CBTFILT.
 * 11/03/2015      RC          3.2.1      Update GetWavesCommandList() to include CBTON.
 * 06/04/2018      RC          3.4.6      Added CBTON and CBI to deployment command list.
